    <h2>About 2 wheeler Insurance</h2>
	<details> 
	  <summary><i> Why Bike insurance is necessary ? </i> </summary>
	 <p>There are a range of situations where your bike insurance policy can protect your bike and you from avoidable expenses. In accordance with the Motor Vehicles Act 1988, it is compulsory for every bike owner in India to have at least a third-party bike insurance policy. But apart from that, a two-wheeler insurance policy can be beneficial in different situations as Follows.</p><br>
	</details> 
	
	<details>
	 <summary><i>Cover against natural and man-made disasters.</i> </summary>
	 <p>In the event of a natural disaster in your area, the financial plan of your two-wheeler insurance policy will cover your bike against damages caused by floods, lightning, cyclones, storms and other natural phenomena. Similarly, the bike insurance plan also protects your two-wheeler against damages caused by man-made acts of violence such as terrorism and vandalism. </p><br>
	</details>
	
	<details>
	 <summary><i>Personal Accident Cover. </i> </summary>
	 <p>While riding your bike, if an unfortunate road accident leaves you with major or minor injuries, your two wheeler insurance can cover all kinds of personal injuries you may have suffered. While the injury itself can be a cause of mental grief, the financial protection offered by the personal accident cover can considerably mitigate the inconvenience! </p>
	</details>
	
	<details>
	 <summary><i>Standalone own damage Bike Insurance Policy. <i> </summary>
	 <p>Our Standalone Own Damage Bike Insurance Policy is beneficial in cases where an unfortunate accident can leave your bike damaged. While the Own Damage cover cannot handle third-party liabilities, your bike can receive financial protection against damages to the bike caused by natural and man-made disasters and fire. This two wheeler policy also offers reimbursement in case of theft of the bike. </p>
	</details>
   
   <details>
	 <summary><i>Protection from legal fines. </i>  </summary>
	 <p>It is illegal to ride your bike without a valid third-party two-wheeler insurance policy. You could attract hefty legal and traffic fines for not carrying a bike insurance policy along. Even within the city limits, it is advisable to always keep your two wheeler insurance policy with you to avoid the hassle of getting into trouble with the law. </p>
